Hi, I'm Krystella!

I'm a graduate student at _The University of the West Indies_ with a background in Geosciences and the oil and gas industry.

During the pandemic I took my first Data Science course - _Data Science Toolbox_ offered by _John Hopkins University_ via _Coursera_, and I've been hooked ever since.

I decided to continue the specialization and have so far completed the following:
* Data Science Toolbox 
* R Programming 
* Getting and Cleaning Data

I'm currently pursuing the 4th course in the Specialization: _Exploratory Data Analysis_. I'm also currently working through _Scientific Computing with Python Certificiation_ via _freecodecamp.org_.
